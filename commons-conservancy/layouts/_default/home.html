                            will continue to do so in the future. If your project has very specific requirements, it may be
                            the best way to go. But not every project can afford the time and cost involved.</p>
                        <p> Having ones own full-blown legal entity solves some issues, but may create new ones. Such as
                            responsibilities which can become somewhat of a burden - like filing quarterly taxes, publishing
                            annual reports or obtaining charitable status to make donations more attractive.</p>
                        <p>For something given away without the intention to make money, the 'opportunity cost' in lost
                            hours that could be spent on the project can be pretty high. </p>

                            multitenancy, which can be reused by open source/free software projects at no cost. It is not a
                            panacea but aims to solve a number of issues people normally start foundations for pretty well -
                            and arguably in some cases does a better job. It is a very nimble and flexible solution,
                            allowing eligible projects to benefit without setup cost or a lot of arguing over details.</p>

                                    <p>FileSender is a (self-)hosted service that allows people to
                                        securely share large files with anyone. It works through your
                                        web browser and you can send a file to anyone with a mail address.
                                        FileSender was originally created with the needs of scientists and
                                        researchers in mind, which means that it scale to extreme file sizes.

                                        <p> Virtual Private Networks are an important class of technologies
                                            that enable secure and private use of networks (such as wifi hotspots)
                                            even in the common case where the trustworthiness of the network is hard
                                            to establish. The use of untrusted wifi networks is as common as it is
                                            risky, and without protection potentially exposes users to all kinds
                                            of attacks. However, setting up VPNs is traditionally a very
                                            cumbersome task. eduVPN is an effort to make VPN technology commonly
                                            available, by building better and more user-friendly tools. </p>
