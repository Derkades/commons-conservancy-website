## Introduction {#introduction}

As a professional organisation and as an open community our guiding principles are respect for the individual, the right to self-determination, the right to make informed decisions and the spirit of cooperation. We aim to be a safe and inclusive environment, fostering a rich diversity of human talent. The Code of Conduct is a codification of the ethical and professional behaviour expected of those engaging with our activities.

The Code of Conduct is based (mutatis mutandis) on the 2016 version of the IEEE Code of Ethics, as established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers through its Ethics and Member Conduct Committee. Maintaining the Code of Conduct is the responsibility of the Board of [The Commons Conservancy], but the demand, ambition and knowledge to do the very best we can is shared throughout our community. Anyone is therefore encouraged to contribute suggestions how to improve the Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct {#code-of-conduct}

We expect the following behaviour to be the norm within [The Commons Conservancy], and thus commit ourselves:

1. to accept responsibility in making decisions consistent with the safety, health, and welfare of the public, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment;
2. to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest whenever possible, and to disclose them to affected parties when they do exist;
3. to be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data;
4. to reject bribery in all its forms;
5. to improve the understanding of technology; its appropriate application, and potential consequences;
6. to maintain and improve personal and collective technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations;
7. to seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors, and to credit properly the contributions of others;
8. to treat fairly all persons and to not engage in acts of discrimination based on race, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression;
9. to avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false or malicious action;
10. to assist others in their professional development and to support them in following this code of ethics.
