GÉANT is a membership organisation acting with and for its members to further research and education networking in Europe and globally. G&Eacute;ANT serves the research and education networking community in Europe, helping them to deliver innovative networks, technologies and services for research and education. Together with a range of community collaboration activities G&Eacute;ANT manages the G&Eacute;ANT project which operates the pan-European data network for the research and education community. It interconnects national research and education networks (NRENs) across Europe, enabling collaboration on projects ranging from biological science to earth observation and arts & culture. The G&Eacute;ANT project combines a high-bandwidth, high-capacity 50,000 km network with a growing range of services. These allow researchers to collaborate, working together wherever they are located. Services include identity and trust, multi-domain monitoring perfSONAR MDM, dynamic circuits and roaming via the eduroam service.

Through interconnections with its 38 National Research and Education Network (NREN) partners, the G&Eacute;ANT network is the largest and most advanced R&E network in the world, connecting over 50 million users at 10,000 institutions across Europe and supporting all scientific disciplines. The backbone network operates at speeds of up to 500Gbps and reaches over 100 national networks worldwide.
