In high security settings, people use hardware devices such as Hardware Security Modules to store cryptographic secrets. But what to do if all you have is a software environment? SoftHSM is a mature and well-tested implementation of a cryptographic store accessible identical to an expensive hardware device, but implemented in software. One can use it to work with standard PKCS #11 everywhere.
