Internet of Coins is a project that aims to create a decentralized, self-sustaining economy by implementing inter-blockchain connectivity. Not through centralized exchanges, nor federated partnerships, or multigateways, but sustained by a hybrid P2P meta-network to leverage each of its participant's strength in numbers. The dream of the project is to integrate all coins into an interconnected and financially liquid nervous system.
