The purpose of the Workflow Orchestrator provides easy-to-use tools, samples and documentation for automating and orchestrating order, administration and provisioning processes. The core of the Workflow Orchestrator consists of a workflow engine that can run processes that result in subscriptions. Based on domain models, a process can be defined from a sequential list of steps (local or remote) that require successful completion of the previous step to proceed. A successful and synchronous subscription can be continuously validated, also based on external system information.
