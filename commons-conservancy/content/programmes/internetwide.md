The goal of the Internet-Wide Organisation is to get more internet technology available to end-users, ranging from individuals to corporations. There are thousands of internet standards, but the facilities available to end-users are pretty much limited to web sites and email. Given the innovative constructions that have been built on top of just these two protocols, we see great potential in adding more valuable internet standards.
