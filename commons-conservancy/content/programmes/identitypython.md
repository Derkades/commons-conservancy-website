Identity management is essential to know who you are dealing with, and as such it is the mandatory starting point for many technologies used across untrusted networks like the internet. IdentityPython is a set of projects that provide implementation of key federation and identity technologies including OpenID Connect, SAML, xmldsig, OAuth, JWT, etc - all implemented in the Python programming language. IdentityPython (often referenced to as idpy) offers a Pythonic way of asserting identity in applications.
