Virtual Private Networks are an important class of technologies that enable secure and private use of networks (such as wifi hotspots) even in the common case where the trustworthiness of the network is hard to establish. The use of untrusted wifi networks is as common as it is risky, and without protection potentially exposes users to all kinds of attacks. However, setting up VPN's is traditionally a very cumbersome task. eduVPN is an effort to make VPN technology commonly available, by building better and more user-friendly tools.
