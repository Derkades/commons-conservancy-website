SimpleSAMLphp is an open source lightweight implementation of several identity federation protocols written in PHP. SimpleSAMLphp (or SSP in short) allows users to be conveniently authenticated, through internet standards like SAML2 and OpenID Connect. SSP is a cornerstone in the authentication and authorisation infrastructures of many National Research and Education Networks, but also in healthcare and government. Furthermore, its battle-tested SAML libraries are used in various more comprensive open source solutions like [OpenConext](https://openconext.org/).
