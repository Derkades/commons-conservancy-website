Honeytrap is a comprehensive, extensible open source system for running, monitoring and managing honeypots. It allows you to redirect attacks and reconnaissance activities aimed at your infrastructure to emulated systems that allow you to learn how your attackers actually go about. HoneyTrap aims to be the leading modular framework for running, monitoring and managing honeypots. Using HoneyTrap you can use sensors, high interaction and low interaction honeypots together, while still using the same event mechanisms. HoneyTrap consists of services, directors, listeners and channels. It is easy to build new services, attach existing honeypots and extend channels or directors.
