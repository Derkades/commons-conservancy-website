PostmarketOS is developing a sustainable, privacy and security focused free software mobile operating system that is modeled after traditional Linux distributions. PostmarketOS is ready to run on older hardware and has been designed with privilege separation in mind. postmarketOS breaks with the paradigm that your phone is no longer useful or safe when vendors lose interest - and allows you to use your device until it physically breaks!
