geteduroam allows people to safely connect to (wireless) networks other than their own. Instead of cumbersome processes to create separate user accounts for roaming, it should be possible to directly use federated identies to automatically generate login credentials for roaming as needed. In addition to the mechanism to create client certificates as needed, geteduroam is developing apps for user devices to automatically install and configure eduroam.
